D3 code for bar charts and histograms of 2010 NYC landcover data (by NTA) 

COMPLETED BITS
1) includes "updates on click" functionality 
2) color for histogram are cover type specific
3) have clicks also update the main bar chart
4) break code up into different files


IN PROGRESS
...  add hover interactivity
--> issue:  adding mouseover and mouseout events works OK on the initial set of rects in the histogram; but adding mouseover and mouseout events with "switch" functions seems to break the updating in the bar chart


TO BE DONE BITS
...  add the cover types that remain
...  work in the skeleton styling
...  add the map
...  add zoom on NTA click
...  add pop-up graph for NTA
...  add new layers
